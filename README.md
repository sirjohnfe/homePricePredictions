# homePricePredictions
In this project I used 7 different models to predict house prices.


The task here is to build a model to predict property prices which have been taken from a small region of Bexar County.

Adataset of 608 properties was used with known values to build the following models

 1)Linear Regression
 2)Ridge Regression
 3)Lasso Regression
 4)Partial Least Squares
 5)Principle Component Analysis
 6)Random Forest 
 7)Gradient Boosting Machine

A dataset was given with the attributes for five properties which did not have listed a prices were predicted the with the model best performing model above.
